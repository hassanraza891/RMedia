# Challenge 1 - Tech Stack

The tech stack i would go with is:

1) .Net 6
   I would use .Net 6 to put together the API's for the application, .Net 6 is the fastest full stack web framework which can perform really well on an on prem server but cloud is where major benefits are seen. If .Net 6 is     deployed to cloud it reduces the computer cost and improves performance. 
3) SQL Server
