# Challenge 1 - Tech Stack

The tech stack i would go with is:

1) I would use .Net 6 to put together the API's for the application, .Net 6 is the fastest full stack web framework which can perform really well on an on prem server but cloud is where major benefits are seen. If .Net 6 is deployed to cloud it reduces the computer cost and improves performance. 
3) SQL Server
4) Latest version of Angular
5) Karma for Angular automated testing
6) Material UI or Bootstrap for design library

# Challenge 2 - Schema Design
Challenge 2 - Schema Design.pdf checked in.

# Challenge 3 - Endpoint Development
Notes:
1) I would first created Db using code first approach in RMEdia.Data project. Create a migration to populate table.
2) Use DB context in RMedia.Service project to process data.
3) Use nunit for automated testing.
4) Use Automapper for mapping values needs for response so that only necessary values are returned and payload could be small.
